# Tailwind
Experimental iOS app for measuring headwinds and tailwinds while cycling.

This simple app is based on the insight that a microphone also works as an anemometerâ€”it can measure windspeed. 

By comparing GPS data with measured decibel values, it is possible to detect the strength of headwinds and tailwinds.

Currently, the app simply logs microphone and GPS data to a `.csv` file that can be analyzed in a spreadsheet or imported to other tools.

- Green line below blue lines means tailwind; airspeed is lower than expected for groundspeed.
- Green line above blue lines means headwind; airspeed is higher than expected for groundspeed.
