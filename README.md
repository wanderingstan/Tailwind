# Tailwind
Experimental iOS app for measuring headwinds and tailwinds while cycling.

This simple app is based on the insight that a [microphone also works as an anemometer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye-C6J7Ku90)â€”it can measure windspeed. 

By comparing decibel values with GPS groundspeed data, it is possible to detect headwinds and tailwinds.

Currently, the app simply logs microphone and GPS data to a `.csv` file that can be analyzed in a spreadsheet or imported to other tools. 

The phone is mounted on bike via a [mount like this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074CBYVX4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

- Green line below blue lines means tailwind; airspeed is lower than expected for groundspeed.
- Green line above blue lines means headwind; airspeed is higher than expected for groundspeed.
